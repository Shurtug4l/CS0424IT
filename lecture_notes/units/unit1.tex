\lecture[4 hours]{27}{05}{2024} % Mark new lectures if you like
Pick between \texttt{seminar}, \texttt{talk} or \texttt{course} (this document) to get appropriately different layouts. Seminars being shorter, for example, will not carry the contents section you see above but are otherwise mostly similar to courses. Talks are two-column layouts, which means you cannot have lecture numbers (on your right) or margin notes (see below). Use appropriate options.
